One of the most striking aspects of Hero is its use of color to convey different perspectives and emotions. The film is divided into four main segments, each with a dominant color scheme: red, blue, green and white. Each color represents a different version of the events that led to the confrontation between Nameless and the assassins, as well as their motivations and feelings. For example, red symbolizes passion, violence and bloodshed; blue symbolizes calmness, truth and sadness; green symbolizes nature, harmony and love; and white symbolizes purity, peace and death. The colors also reflect the characters' personalities and relationships: Flying Snow is associated with red, as she is driven by revenge and anger; Broken Sword is associated with blue, as he is a seeker of wisdom and peace; Nameless is associated with green, as he is a loyal servant of his country and a lover of Flying Snow; and the King of Qin is associated with white, as he is a ruthless ruler who desires to unify China under his rule.
 
Another remarkable aspect of Hero is its choreography and cinematography. The film features some of the most spectacular and graceful martial arts sequences ever filmed, combining realistic stunts with wire work and special effects. The film also showcases the diverse and beautiful landscapes of China, from deserts and lakes to forests and mountains. The film was shot by Christopher Doyle , one of the most acclaimed cinematographers in the world, who collaborated with Zhang Yimou on several other films. Doyle's camera work captures the movement and emotion of the characters, as well as the stunning visual effects created by color filters and digital enhancements. The film also features a haunting and majestic score by Tan Dun , who won an Academy Award for his music for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon . The score blends traditional Chinese instruments with Western orchestration, creating a unique and memorable soundtrack.
 
Hero is not only a feast for the eyes and ears, but also a profound exploration of the themes of heroism, loyalty, sacrifice and destiny. The film poses questions about what makes a hero, what is the value of life, what is the meaning of peace, and what is the cost of power. The film also examines the historical and cultural context of China during the Warring States period, when different philosophies and ideologies competed for influence and legitimacy. The film draws inspiration from various sources, such as the historical figure of Jing Ke , the legend of King Goujian , the philosophy of Laozi , and the art of calligraphy . The film also pays homage to other wuxia films, such as Come Drink with Me , A Touch of Zen , Dragon Inn , Ashes of Time , and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon .
