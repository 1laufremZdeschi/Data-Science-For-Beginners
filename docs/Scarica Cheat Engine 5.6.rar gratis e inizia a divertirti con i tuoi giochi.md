## Using Cheat Engine 5.6 to Hack Your Favorite Games
 
Now that you have Cheat Engine running, you can start hacking your favorite games. Here are the basic steps to follow:
 
1. Open the game that you want to hack in a window or fullscreen mode.
2. Switch back to Cheat Engine and click on the "Select a process to open" button (the computer icon) on the top left corner of the window.
3. A list of all the processes running on your computer will appear. Find the process that corresponds to your game (usually the name of the game or its executable file) and click on it. Then click on "Open".
4. Cheat Engine will attach itself to the game process and show you some information about it on the bottom panel.
5. Now you need to find the value that you want to change in the game, such as your health, money, speed, etc. For example, if you want to change your health in a game, you need to know how much health you have in the game.
6. Switch back to the game and check your health value. For example, if you have 100 health in the game, remember this number.
7. Switch back to Cheat Engine and enter the value that you want to find in the "Value" box under "Scan Type". For example, if you have 100 health in the game, enter 100 in the "Value" box.
8. Select the type of value that you are looking for from the drop-down menu next to "Value Type". For example, if you are looking for a number between 0 and 255, select "Byte". If you are not sure what type of value you are looking for, select "All" or "Unknown initial value".
9. Click on "First Scan" button on the right side of the window. Cheat Engine will scan the memory of the game process and show you all the addresses that contain the value that you entered in the left panel.
10. Usually, there will be too many results to find the exact address that you are looking for. You need to narrow down the results by changing the value in the game and scanning again.
11. Switch back to the game and do something that changes the value that you are looking for. For example, if you are looking for your health value, get hit by an enemy or heal yourself.
12. Switch back to Cheat Engine and enter the new value that you have in the game in the "Value" box under "Scan Type". For example, if 8cf37b1e13
