## What is Science and Development of Muscle Hypertrophy?
 
Science and Development of Muscle Hypertrophy is a book that aims to provide the most comprehensive resource on muscle hypertrophy in the world. It covers the mechanism of muscle growth, how the body adapts to stress, how to design effective training programs, and how to optimize nutrition for hypertrophy. The book is divided into three parts:
 
- Part I: The Mechanisms of Hypertrophy. This part explains the cellular and molecular processes that underlie muscle hypertrophy, such as satellite cell activation, protein synthesis, hormonal responses, and genetic factors.
- Part II: The Program Variables of Hypertrophy. This part discusses the various factors that influence muscle hypertrophy, such as volume, intensity, frequency, rest intervals, exercise selection, exercise order, range of motion, tempo, advanced techniques, and periodization.
- Part III: The Practical Application of Hypertrophy. This part provides guidelines for applying the principles of hypertrophy to different populations, such as beginners, intermediates, advanced lifters, women, older adults, athletes, and bodybuilders.

The book also includes two new chapters in the second edition: one on the measurement of muscle hypertrophy, and one on advanced training practices for maximizing genetic potential. The book is based on more than 1,000 references and applied guidelines from the author's extensive experience as a researcher and practitioner.
