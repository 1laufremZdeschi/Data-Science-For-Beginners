# UNDERTALE - Lossless Soundtrack: A Review
 
UNDERTALE is a role-playing game that has captivated millions of players with its charming pixel art, quirky humor, and emotional story. The game's soundtrack, composed by Toby Fox, is one of its most praised aspects, featuring over 100 tracks that range from catchy tunes to haunting melodies. But how does the soundtrack sound in its original lossless format?

Lossless audio is a type of digital audio that preserves all the details and quality of the original recording, without any compression or degradation. This means that the sound is more clear, crisp, and dynamic than the typical mp3 or ogg formats that are used for most games and music streaming services. Lossless audio formats include flac, wav, alac, and ape.
 
The UNDERTALE - Lossless Soundtrack is a collection of flac files that can be downloaded from Archive.org[^1^] or SoundCloud[^2^]. The files are sourced from the official UNDERTALE soundtrack that is available on Bandcamp, iTunes, Spotify, and other platforms. The files can be played on any device or software that supports flac playback, such as VLC, Foobar2000, Winamp, or Audacity.
 
The advantage of listening to the UNDERTALE - Lossless Soundtrack is that you can hear every nuance and detail of Toby Fox's compositions, as well as appreciate the sound quality and fidelity of the instruments and samples he used. For example, you can hear the subtle variations in the piano notes in "Once Upon a Time", the crispness of the drums and bass in "Megalovania", or the richness of the strings and choir in "Hopes and Dreams". You can also notice some differences between the lossless and compressed versions of some tracks, such as the volume levels, the stereo balance, or the reverb effects.
 
The downside of listening to the UNDERTALE - Lossless Soundtrack is that the files are much larger than the compressed ones, taking up more space on your device or hard drive. For instance, the entire soundtrack in flac format is about 1.6 GB, while in mp3 format it is only about 300 MB. Moreover, some devices or software may not support flac playback natively, requiring additional plugins or converters. Finally, some listeners may not notice any significant difference between lossless and compressed audio, depending on their hearing abilities, audio equipment, or listening environment.
 
In conclusion, the UNDERTALE - Lossless Soundtrack is a great option for fans of the game who want to enjoy its music in its highest quality and fidelity. However, it may not be suitable for everyone due to its large file size and compatibility issues. If you are interested in trying it out, you can download it from Archive.org[^1^] or SoundCloud[^2^], or use a patcher tool like FlacMyGame[^3^] to replace the game's original audio files with flac ones.

If you are curious about how the UNDERTALE - Lossless Soundtrack was created, you can read more about the process and the challenges involved in this blog post by sobitcorp, the developer of FlacMyGame. FlacMyGame is a tool that allows you to replace the game's original audio files with flac ones, without modifying the game's code or data. This way, you can enjoy the lossless soundtrack while playing the game, without any performance issues or glitches.
 
To use FlacMyGame, you need to have the game's original soundtrack in flac or mp3 format, as well as the game itself installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of FlacMyGame from GitHub, and extract it into a new folder in your game directory (e.g. C:\Undertale\flacmygame if Undertale is in C:\Undertale). Then, you need to prepare the original soundtrack by renaming the files according to the game's track list, and placing them in a subfolder called "flac" or "mp3" inside the flacmygame folder. For example, the first track should be named "001 - Once Upon a Time.flac" or "001 - Once Upon a Time.mp3". You can find the full track list and instructions on how to rename the files on GitHub.
 
Once you have prepared the soundtrack, you can run FlacMyGame.exe and follow the instructions on the screen. The tool will scan your game directory and detect the audio files that need to be replaced. It will then create backup copies of the original files and replace them with flac or mp3 ones. You can also choose to restore the original files at any time by running FlacMyGame.exe again. After the process is complete, you can launch the game normally and enjoy the lossless soundtrack.
 
FlacMyGame currently supports UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE Chapter 1&2, but it may work with other games that use similar audio formats and structures. However, it is not guaranteed to work with every game, and it may cause some errors or crashes if used incorrectly. Therefore, use it at your own risk and always backup your game files before using it.
