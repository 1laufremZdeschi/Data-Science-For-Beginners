To use Magic Uneraser 3.1, you need to download and install the FREE version from the official website (www.magicuneraser.com). The FREE version can detect deleted files and partitions and let you preview their content before recovery. However, to recover more than one file per session or to recover a partition, you need to purchase a registration key and activate the software.
 
The registration key costs $39.95 for a personal license or $99.95 for a corporate license. You can buy it online from the official website or from many third-party resellers. After payment, you will receive an email with your registration name and key. You can enter them in the software by clicking on the "Registration" button on the program panel or by selecting "Enter Registration Key" from the Help menu.
 
Once you have activated the software, you can proceed with the recovery process. You can choose from three different modes: "Recover Files", "Recover Partitions", or "Create Disk Image". Depending on your situation, you can select the appropriate mode and follow the instructions on the screen. Magic Uneraser 3.1 will scan your disk and display a list of recoverable files and partitions. You can then select the ones you want to restore and save them to a different location.
 
Magic Uneraser 3.1 is a reliable and easy-to-use data recovery software that can help you recover your important files and partitions in no time. If you have lost any data due to deletion, formatting, or corruption, don't panic. Just download Magic Uneraser 3.1 and get your data back.
  
Magic Uneraser 3.1 is not only a data recovery software, but also a data protection software. It can create disk images of your entire disk or selected partitions, which can be used as backups or as sources for recovery. Disk images are exact copies of your disk data, including the file system and the boot sector. You can create disk images in compressed or uncompressed formats, and save them to any location you want.
 
Another feature of Magic Uneraser 3.1 is its ability to recover files from virtual disks. If you use virtual machines such as VMware, VirtualBox, or Hyper-V, you can recover data from their virtual disks using Magic Uneraser 3.1. You can also recover data from encrypted disks, such as BitLocker or TrueCrypt, as long as you know the password or have the key file.
 
Magic Uneraser 3.1 is compatible with all versions of Windows, from Windows XP to Windows 10. It can also recover data from Linux and Mac disks, as well as from various types of removable media, such as USB flash drives, memory cards, external hard drives, and digital cameras.
